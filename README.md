🚀 Space Shooter
A fast-paced, retro-style arcade game built with Pygame.
Pilot your yellow fighter, blast incoming enemy fleets, and survive as long as you can.
Works out-of-the-box—no external assets required—but ready to accept your own pixel-art for ships, lasers, and backgrounds.
✨ Features
Zero-setup fallback graphics & sounds – the game runs even if you provide no assets
3 enemy types (red / green / blue) with unique laser colors
Procedural starfield background
Explosion animations & laser trails
Thrust flame on the player ship
Health bar & lives counter
Progressive difficulty – enemy waves grow larger every level
Pew-pew sound (plays if you drop a file into assets/)
